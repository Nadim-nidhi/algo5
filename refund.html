             <h4>4. RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT</h4>
             <p>We accept requests from Users to code and deploy trading strategies.
Code is the process to take input and exit conditions from Users, conditions for setting a stop loss and target, instrument, quantity of stocks, risk per trade etc. and form a trading strategy, hereafter referred to as "trading strategy" or "strategy" or "strategies". We strive to give you accurate information on your trading strategies and your strategies, however methodology covers the PROCESS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE MADE DURING CALCULATING THE RESULTS OF THE STRATEGY AND THE DATA SHOWN AFTER DEPLOYMENT.
Using Our Services, including the deploy services, automated trading services, presents several different types of risk. We have summarized these below and You are solely liable to read and understand these risks before you use any of Our Services. The risks that can arise from using our Services is broadly classified as: (i) Risks inherent generally in using Internet-based technology; (ii) Risks inherent in creating and deploying trading strategies; and (iii) Risks inherent in engaging in live automation trading.
ANY PERMUTATION OR COMBINATION OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE POTENTIAL EVENTS THAT DEFINE THE RISKS DESCRIBED IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENTS CAN LEAD TO A TOTAL OR PARTIAL LOSS OF OPERABILITY, RESPONSIVENESS, FUNCTIONALITY, AND FEATURES THAT COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT YOUR USE OF PLATFORM.</p>

<h4>5. RISKS IN CREATIONAND DEPLOYING STRATEGIES (STRATEGIES)</h4>
<p>Creating and deploying computer-based trading strategies is subject to several risks, any of which can cause your strategies to not function as you had intended or fail to achieve one or more of the objectives of your strategies. Automation trading is rapidly changing as a practice and as an industry. Models of markets used to write and test trading strategies are inherently limited and often fail to perform as expected. In addition, trading strategies are implemented in software programming code, and no matter how well designed and thoroughly tested, any such code can have logical errors and bugs that cause the strategies to malfunction or suggest or trigger trades that, if executed, would result in losses. It is your obligation to thoroughly and appropriately test any automated systematic trading strategy before you deploy it and to continually monitor the operation of any deployed automated systematic trading strategy to ensure it is running properly and in compliance with any applicable rules
a. Your automation trading strategy may be designed on the basis of an incorrect understanding of technical parameters or indicators which may not work as expected.
b. Your automation trading strategy may contain logical errors in the way you understand the technical parameters or indicators.
c. Errors may exist in the data used for testing your automation systematic trading strategy or the applicable model of the market.
d. Your automation trading strategy might appear to succeed while using historical data, but fail when using live data.
e. Your automation trading strategy might appear to succeed with some data sources, but fail when using other data sources in our system.
f. Your automation trading strategy may not achieve the returns you anticipate. There are no guarantees, or even expectations, that can be made about the future behavior of an automation systematic trading strategy.</p>

<h4>6. RISKS OF ENGAGING IN LIVE AUTOMATED SYSTEMATIC TRADING AND RELATED STRATEGIES</h4>

<p>Our Services allow you to engage in live trading using the broker’s API access given to you by the broker. Engaging in live trading subjects you to:
(a) the risks associated with trading generally, and
(b) the risks associated with live automated trading
THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISKS, ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH ANY OF THE OTHER RISKS DESCRIBED IN THIS DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF ALL OF THE MONEY YOU HAVE DEPOSITED IN THE BROKERAGE ACCOUNT YOU USE FOR LIVE TRADING BASED ON THE STRATEGIES YOU WRITE, TEST, AND RUN ON OUR PLATFORM. LOSSES CAN HAPPEN MORE QUICKLY WHEN USING AUTOMATED TRADING THAN OTHER FORMS OF TRADING. YOU SHOULD DISCUSS WITH AN INVESTMENT PROFESSIONAL THE RISKS OF TRADING IN GENERAL AND AUTOMATED TRADING IN PARTICULAR. YOU USE ANY STRATEGY IN LIVE TRADING AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IT IS YOUR OBLIGATION TO THOROUGHLY AND APPROPRIATELY TEST ANY TRADING STRATEGY BEFORE YOU DEPLOY IT AND TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE OPERATION OF ANY DEPLOYED TRADING STRATEGY TO ENSURE IT IS RUNNING PROPERLY AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE RULES.</p>

<h4>7. CERTAIN RISKS OF LIVE AUTOMATED TRADING</h4>
<p>In addition to all of the risks described above, live automated trading is subject to the following types of types of risk:

i. Kindly take note that it is not possible for a computer model to truly predict what might have happened if an automated trading strategy was in play in a live trading environment. For example, the implementation of such a strategy can itself have an impact on the market, and the model may fail to account for real-life factors that impact the model. Moreover, the model may fail to account for execution costs including margins required in the trading account, broker commissions, fees, and trading slippage. A promising model result does not necessarily predict a successful strategy. Execution of an automated trading strategy and the performance of that code may prove to be impossible in a live trading environment. Changes in various market factors not foreseen in a model can change, causing a strategy to fail. Orders that were executed correctly in the past events/circumstances may be disallowed or rejected because of various reasons e.g.: margin requirement, illiquid securities etc. causing the automated strategy/code to fail or otherwise not perform as expected. Attempts to create, exit, or cancel orders might fail, or might result in unexpected outcomes. Moreover, your automated strategy/code might not handle market conditions that cannot be reasonably anticipated, i.e., a “flash crash” or an exchange outage. These market conditions, by definition, will not have been tested.
ii. The relevant market might fail or behave unexpectedly. Markets in which you seeking to implement your trading strategy may fail or behave incorrectly because of technical reasons relating to infrastructure, connectivity, and similar factors. Your automated strategy/code might suffer from adverse market conditions. Those conditions can include lack of liquidity, and abrupt and unwarranted price swings. Also possible are late market openings, early market closings, market chaos, and mid-day trading pauses, and other such disruptive events.
iii. Your broker may experience failures in its infrastructure, fail to execute your orders in a correct or timely fashion or reject your orders. This Platform’s infrastructure on which you are running your automated strategy/code might fail. In addition, even if this Platform’s infrastructure or your broker's infrastructure and API are working correctly, the orders may get rejected or triggered in error or by design, incorrectly execute orders, or induce errors through unexpected behaviour (such as returning messages out of sequence, incorrectly acknowledging orders, or posting incorrect execution reports). If at all, any losses arise from these risks, We do not bear any responsibility for this.
iv. The system you use for generating trading orders, communicating those orders to your broker, and receiving queries and trading results from your broker may fail or not function in a correct or timely manner. Latency (i.e., delays) within and between your system, between our servers and the broker and the exchanges, as well as those of your broker and the exchanges in which you seeking to affect trades, might cause orders, modifications, and cancels to be placed or not placed in ways that are not desired. You may receive incorrect information, or be unable to get information, about your orders, your positions, or market conditions. Incorrect actions may be taken, or correct actions may not be taken, because of inaccurate or missing information. In addition, you may be unable to terminate, pause or modify parameters or instructions of your automated strategy/code.
v. Time lag at various point in live trading might cause unexpected behaviour. The time lag between trade signal generation time, the time at which you receive the trade signal, and the time at which you or the automated strategy/code take action on the alert, can cause a delayed order placement in the market, lead to cancellations and cause you loss (or fail to gain profits) and may deliver unanticipated results vastly different from the historical results.
vi. The systems of third parties in addition to those of the provider from which we obtain various services, your broker, and the applicable securities market may fail or malfunction. Automated trading using Our Services depends on the availability of various services from third parties in addition to your service provider and your broker. These, for example, include providers of data services, computational services, and network connectivity. The operations of these third parties are beyond all of our reasonable control. Regardless of the reason for any failure by your broker, the market in which you seek to have trades executed, or these other third parties, we will not have any liability for any such failure. Accurate and complete real-time price data is critical for the success of automated trading. The systems of these data providers could experience failures, errors, and latency, which could result in missing, incorrect, or stale market data.
vii. Malicious and criminal activities might cause your strategy or strategies to fail, or your brokerage account to be compromised. All computers and networks are subject to malicious “hacking” attacks and criminal activities designed to misappropriate intellectual property, compromise personally identifiable information, steal funds, or any combination of such purposes. These attacks might be attacks on a target of opportunity or specifically targeted. Each of the various systems described above that are necessary for you to engage in live automated trading is subject to such attack. Any such attack could cause the system to function improperly or not function at all, and could result in the misappropriation of your intellectual property, the compromise of your personally identifiable information and personal financial information, the theft of your funds and can cause your strategy misbehave, malfunction or behave erratically.</p>
